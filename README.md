## Description of application
This engaging application offers an immersive gaming experience in the form of a hidden object game. Your objective is to locate a specific image from a given list of objects. To confirm your discovery, simply aim your camera at the sought-after image. And here's the exciting part â€“ successfully uncovering all the hidden images unlocks a well-deserved and rewarding prize!

To bring this delightful concept to life, we harnessed the power of Unity, a versatile and robust platform for creating interactive and visually stunning experiences. Let's delve into the intricacies of how this intriguing application was meticulously crafted.

**User Interface and Transition**:
The journey begins on a user-friendly interface, thoughtfully designed using Unity's fundamental assets. Upon initiating the game by clicking the "Start Game" button, users are seamlessly transported into the world of augmented reality (AR) within the application.

**Visual Clues**:
At the bottom of the screen, six transparent boxes play a pivotal role in guiding the user. These boxes serve as visual cues, hinting at the items that must be located within the area. These item images were meticulously curated and uploaded to the Vuforia portal, subsequently imported into Unity as a custom package. It's worth noting that certain images are intentionally marked as incorrect, and this is cleverly conveyed through a distinctive sound cue reminiscent of the suspenseful sound effects found in popular game shows. In a similar vein, when an image is correctly identified, triggering the corresponding audio cue leads to the satisfying removal of the corresponding box.

**The Rewarding Climax**:
Once all the boxes have been triumphantly removed from the AR landscape, the application notifies the user of their eligibility to claim a delightful "prize." The process involves scanning a designated image displayed on the screen, and upon scanning this image, users are treated to a celebratory video as their well-deserved "prize."

**Image Attribution**:
All the captivating images used in this application have been sourced from the treasure trove of creativity at https://pixabay.com and can be conveniently perused in the images folder thoughtfully included in this repository. For clarity, "Invalid" pertains to images earmarked as incorrect within the context of the game, while "Valid" denotes images confirmed as correct. As for "Prize.jpeg," this intriguing image serves as the gateway to the enchanting celebratory video, marking the culmination of your gaming adventure.
